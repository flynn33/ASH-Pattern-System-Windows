# Implementation Acceptance — canonical verification requirements (9D Research Baseline)

## Purpose

This specification defines the **minimum acceptance threshold** for the Windows implementation to be considered conformant with the ASH Pattern System, grounded in the full 9D research baseline.

**Codeword-set closure**: The codeword set `C ⊂ F2^9` is fully closed. `C` is a [9, 4, 4] doubly-even linear code with 16 members, extracted from published research (see `specs/core/codeword-set.pseudo.md`). All codeword-dependent invariants can now be fully assessed. Implementations must use exactly the specified 16-codeword set.

---

## Minimum acceptance conditions

The Windows implementation is **accepted as conformant** if and only if:

1. **All invariants pass** — every invariant in `invariant-spec.md` must be verified and must pass.

2. **All 5 conformance categories are covered** — every category in `conformance-categories.md` must be represented in the test suite.

3. **Per-module contracts are satisfied** — every module contract in `specs/interfaces/contracts/` must be satisfied as grounded in the 9D baseline.

4. **Diagnostics are complete** — the diagnostic chain is conformant with the shared schema and taxonomy.

---

## Failure conditions

The Windows implementation is **non-conformant** if any of the following:

1. Any non-codeword-dependent invariant fails
2. Any conformance category is missing from the test suite
3. The implementation decomposes the 9-bit state into an 8-bit core + derived 9th bit for canonical processing
4. The materialization boundary is violated
5. Diagnostics are incomplete or non-conformant with the schema/taxonomy
6. Silent healing occurs (recovery without diagnostics)
7. The implementation invents codewords not grounded in the research baseline

## Non-waivable requirements

The following may **not be waived, deferred, or locally overridden**:

| Requirement | Source |
|---|---|
| Full F2^9 state space | `ash-state-space.pseudo.md` |
| XOR-by-codeword as canonical transformation | `codeword-transformation-semantics.pseudo.md` |
| Materialization boundary (planner/emitter separation) | `generation-planner-contract.md`, `artifact-emitter-contract.md` |
| Fallback-policy registry conformance | `fallback-policy-registry.md` |
| Diagnostic schema conformance | `diagnostic-schema.md` |
| Rule-ID taxonomy conformance | `rule-id-taxonomy.md` |
| SAFE_HALT terminal finality | `containment-safe-failure-semantics.pseudo.md` |
| Monotonic escalation | `recoverability-semantics.pseudo.md` |
| No 8+1 decomposition as canonical | R1 realignment decision |

## Acceptance judgment language

### CONFORMANT
All invariants pass, all 5 categories are covered, all contracts are satisfied, and diagnostics are complete.

### CONFORMANT WITH CAVEATS
All of the above, plus: one or more caveats exist that do not affect core conformance. The caveat must name the specific item.

### NON-CONFORMANT
Any acceptance condition is not met. The judgment must include: failing invariants (by ID), failing categories, and recommendations for remediation.

### PARTIAL — not a valid judgment
There is no "partial conformance." An implementation is CONFORMANT, CONFORMANT WITH CAVEATS, or NON-CONFORMANT.
