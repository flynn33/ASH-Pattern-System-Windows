# ASH Pattern System

## Canonical Agnostic Repository

This repository is the **platform-neutral, language-neutral source of truth** for the ASH Pattern System.

It is the agnostic specification repository grounded in the **full 9-dimensional ASH research math**.

> **Post-R3 status**: This repository is grounded in the full 9D ASH research baseline (R1). State/recovery semantics (R2) and contract/verification layers (R3) have been rebuilt on the 9D foundation. The exhaustive codeword-set enumeration (`C ⊂ F2^9`) remains pending research closure.

## Repository purpose

The ASH Pattern System is a **platform-agnostic and code-agnostic framework** for:

- **self-healing software** — systems that detect and correct their own state errors
- **self-correcting software** — systems that restore valid state from corrupted state
- **safe-failure behavior** — systems that halt safely when correction is impossible
- **fallback behavior** — systems that select known-good states when correction is ambiguous
- **deterministic recovery planning** — systems that plan recovery actions from structured diagnostics
- **resilient system design** — systems that degrade gracefully through containment rather than fail silently

This repository defines:

- the canonical ASH state space as **F2^9** — full 9-dimensional binary state space with 512 vertices
- canonical state transformations via **XOR-by-codeword** (`x' = x ⊕ c` for `c ∈ C ⊂ F2^9`)
- canonical **averaging operator** `T` with `T² = T` (projection onto C-invariant functions)
- canonical **branching / leaf expansion** as a first-class capability
- deterministic transition semantics on full 9-bit states
- deterministic topology expansion semantics
- axiom evaluation semantics
- generation-planning semantics
- realm identity encoding from full 9-bit states
- resilient software semantics (classification, recovery, fallback, containment, safe failure) — rebuilt on 9D baseline
- implementation contracts for all 9 required semantic modules — rebuilt on 9D baseline in R3
- invariant-based verification requirements for downstream conformance — rebuilt on 9D baseline in R3

This repository does **not** define:

- a canonical programming language
- a canonical operating system or platform
- a canonical build system
- a canonical CLI
- a canonical UI or rendering layer
- a canonical filesystem layout for emitted projects

## Design stance

The engine core must remain stable even when downstream implementations differ.

That means:

- the **specifications are canonical**
- implementations are adapters to the specifications
- semantics come before syntax
- planning comes before materialization
- the state model comes before platform behavior

## Core state-space model (Research Baseline)

The ASH state space is **F2^9** — the full 9-dimensional binary state space with **512 states** (vertices / realms).

Each state is a 9-bit binary vector `(b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8)`. All 9 coordinates participate in the algebraic structure. No coordinate is structurally privileged as a "derived" dimension at the foundational level.

Canonical motion between states is **XOR-by-codeword**: `x' = x ⊕ c` where `c ∈ C ⊂ F2^9`.

## Intended use

A future coding agent should receive this repository plus a build-target instruction such as:

- implement the ASH Pattern System for Rust
- implement the ASH Pattern System for Swift
- implement the ASH Pattern System for C++
- implement the ASH Pattern System for TypeScript
- implement the ASH Pattern System for a service runtime
- implement the ASH Pattern System for a mobile runtime

The build target may change.
The semantic source of truth must not.
